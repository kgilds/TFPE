Welcome to Eastern 9,Cohorts|Eastern 9,No,"Hi, Jeff 

My primary goal would be to nudge someone who is thinking about making the plunge into coding but not sure how to go about it. Sometimes a current evaluation process is fine using spreadsheets. However, even then I will have a section on data management practices with spreadsheets--I am opinionated on these items!

Kevin Gilds -Dailies,Dailies,No,"Goals Structure for this book:

Target Audience: Manager or analyst at nonprofit or government agency that is frustrated with their evaluation/data management process and is looking for options. Jumping into tutorials for R and Python is daunting as one may encounter odd terms like ""foo"" and ""bar"". In reality these terms, are place holders but rarely is this explained.   

Identify scenarios where coding may be more beneficial than using a spreadsheet. Acknowledge that using a spreadsheet may be the best option.

Benefits of coding an analysis: 

* Reproducibility 
* Automation 
* Git-version control
* Testing  


If the person  chooses to use a spreadsheet, provide some best practices for using spreadsheets.

1. Never touch (alter)  the raw data
2. Keeping your data tidy in a spreadsheet format.

(this is rough but wanted a framework for how I started learning to code)

I recall starting a new job at a nonprofit organization and noted that the organization had a license for SPSS. However, the challenge was that SPSS and  the license  were locked down on a worthless laptop. The cost to re-license SPSS was in the thousands and obtaining a new license did not seem worth the investment. This started my quest for alternatives to high priced statistical software. 

What I did not know at this time was that  nonprofit organizations  have access  powerful data analysis tools. It is open source software and  is not a special program through Tech Soup. R and Python are available for any organization to utilize. In Facebook, and Google utilize both R and Python to analyze data.How many nonprofit organizations are even aware of this or have the capacity to take advantage of these tools?   

I recall downloading opening R and having no idea what to do with it. Here is a screenshot of what one may find when opening R.

Depending how far one is down in the hierarchy it can often be worse. You have staff trying to serve people and they are being drowned in data. They come up with solutions that sub-optimal that provide them with busy work. Instead of calling and helping people they are re-writing addresses that should have easily come out of the database.

This article is a good starting point for topic of spreadsheets--that is if you must use a spreadsheet do it this way.
https://github.com/kbroman/Paper_DataOrg/blob/master/manuscript.pdf



I have a story/example for each element/point

* Be consistent
* Choose good names for things--
* Dates as YYYY-MM-DD
* No empty cells
* Put just one thing in a cell
* Make it rectangle--
* Create a data dictionary
* No calculations in the raw data
* No font colors or highlighting as data. 
* Make backups
* Use Data validation--using drop downs let one be consistent. 
* Save the data in plain text.

Something to think about is use the story below has an example and create the wrong spreadsheet.

Yesterday I wrote about best practices with spreadsheets. When I finished up, I had a flashback trying to parse and make sense of a spreadsheet that defied all of the conventions.

The highlights of this spreadsheet. 

1. Colors conveyed an outcome

2. Dates were in many formats--of course none in  YYYY-MM-DD. 

3. And My personal favorite is when someone puts more than one value in a cell.

A useful guide for data management can be found [here](https://cghlewis.github.io/mpsi-data-training/training_00.html)

The FAIR Principles for scientific data management and stewardship are provided. I think these principles should apply in most contexts. 

1. Findable: The move towards automation means metadata needs good documentation and machine readable.

2. Accessible: Data is available in a repository or though a request system

3. Interoperable: Humans and machines need to be able to read and understand the data. There should not be a barrier to the data in terms of a software license. Documentation should pair with the data to make it useful.

From here: https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files?slide=4

One of my favorite hacks has been to have a consistent filing naming scheme. 

Below are some guidelines to think about. 

File Names:
1. machine readable
2. human readable
3. logical default ordering



How to make it machine readable: Avoid spaces at all costs and purposeful use of delimiters. ie  ""-"" ""_""
Making it machine readable helps you search and filter files.  Add specific examples.

Human readable: content is king. See wikipedia article on slugs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL
For additional human readable conventions: See this post from Emily Riederer. https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/column-name-contracts/. Column names can serve as a contract between the data producer and data consumer to help ensure understanding of the data. 

Logical default ordering: Use numbers and if you use a dates use ISO 8601. Make your life easier.

The content expert does not have to be an expert at coding  but know enough to apply some concepts in a project.  
  
My purpose  has been to give encouragement to those that may have the itch but not sure where or how to start or to hire me to do it.

 Here is a report with some data we need and here is another report with the other part of the data we need. Of course, we can't query the database to get the report we need that would make too much sense. *At least the two reports have unique key values for matching*

I though about this image today as I was preparing and Account Receivable report today. Mostly, I was pondering why I don't have a script for it...but I digress.

I had to clean up the report in sheets--part of a key value is in a string so I extract the string use a vlookup to find match client names. Spent a few minutes looking up a function to recall which ones combines strings not just values. The data is now transformed  and I could visualize it or I could create model or in my case run a pivot table.  Even though this only takes about 15 minutes--it is a waste of time! It should be in a script so anyone could generate this report.

I am happy I looked this diagram up because I liked the discussion centered around the diagram. 

1. Tidy the data--putting the data in a useful structure

* 1. Each column is a variable
* 2. Each row is an observation 
Having your data in a tidy format lets you focus on your question.

2. Transform the data
* Filtering the data, adding new variables, summary statistics

3. Visualize your data @thomasnealley --the quote below blew my mind.  
> A good visualisation might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. -Wickham & Grolemund  
  This quote hits in my experience.

4. Modeling  
* A model can complement a visual and they scale were a visual may not.

A good point here is that visualization and modeling have pros and cons, and the cycle reflects that an good analysis will cycle numerous times between them. 

The visuals and models help you communicate to your audience.

Learning to code is a skill. I recall it being awkward and uncomfortable to start. 

* Empathy for a new coder: How can I bring community to this for people who want to take the plunge?
It would be very challenging to be a single employee trying to implement this change? This person would have to bring a proof of concept really fast that solved a problem.

And then there was SQL. Actually I need to bring this language up for discussion at some point.

This post will be about the importance of content and technical skills. 

See this article: https://blog.devgenius.io/the-data-scientist-of-the-future-according-to-google-4d8545b37bdc

> Domain Knowledge will rule the world

The author holds that an understanding of the inputs and outputs of a model will be key and MBA students will be learning SQL. 

I am biased toward the belief that domain knowledge is critical to help you understand the data. I want to believe this and It is my experience as well that context matters. I have strong diversion against completing visualizations or machine models if I don't understand the context of the data.

A common recommendation is for new comers to learn SQL. I think MS Access would be okay and [Sqlite](https://sqlite.org/index.html) would be a good staring point as well.  I don't disagree and a critical skill to learn is how to 'join' data. Also the concept of normalizing data is related to tidy data.

I know what you mean by this

They are run by data analytics people, and while they get input from ‘church oriented’ people, the end products clearly devalue their perspective in favor of presenting a data-driven perspective.

I have experienced this often in the nonprofit sector. 

Have you heard of the phrase eating your own dog food in software development? The idea that the builder actually uses the tools and can anticipate what others need and make adjustments. The builder can build products with empathy for the end users. 

The article I posted is a close cousin to this concept and most likely there is some overlap. The content expert will know what variables make good predictions on a given outcome. They will know what data transformations to make a mode more accurate in predictions. They would have a sense if a model was rubbish.

This is a very helpful class on learning Python https://www.py4e.com/

What I liked about the author's approach is that he indicated computers are not very smart. You have to be literal with them. This is what I meant the other day when mentioned learning to craft your tool. Don't view the output of the  computer as magic but as pure logic executed. However-it may not be the logic you want but it is the logic someone programmed. 

I like this line of reasoning but we are venturing into Zen and the *Are of Motorcycle Maintenance* territory.

Reproducibility: Do you get the same numbers if you run the analysis again. It is important in science and  equally important in business. 

In the same general idea: What happens if a client determines they missed entering 100 surveys. How much pain will it be to re-run an analysis. How much effort will you have to undertake to recreate the analysis. 

How easy is it to check and show your work and how to came to a conclusion?

Your computer crashes? How long before you can be up and running again? Hello git and Digital Ocean

How easy is for you to modify or change an assumption in your data that may impact your analysis?

A loose connection with my book but it is what on my mind. 

Today I had to be the intermediary between partnering agencies that were talking past each other in solving a data problem . My observation was that there was no common language between the two and I had the opportunity to be the bridge between the two. 

The no common language theme made me think of this book:  https://www.amazon.com/Trying-Hard-Good-Enough-Anniversary/dp/1516971620/ref=asc_df_1516971620/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312111868709&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7996590488522633806&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012161&hvtargid=pla-473618412914&psc=1

A major theme of this book is using common language in the evaluation process. 

I handled this well by doing the following 

1. Be nice
2. Assert the assumptions instead of accusations 
3. Provide reproducible example 
4. Layout next steps.

Order of operations--the order of your calculations matters when computing a math problem.

Order of operations also matter with computers as well.  I had to do a near complete re-install of Pop-Os last week and had to reinstall some programs. I could not get VS code to recognize Docker.  I was searching and searching for what steps I missed and had a strong hunch is was about user permission. 

I determined I had updated this in Docker after installing VS code. So I Uninstalled VS code and did a quick reinstall and now everything is working as expected. 

Maybe this will bridge somewhere but I suspect it aligns with thinking like or communicating effectively with your computer.",1,2,https://wc3.akimbo.com/t/kevin-gilds-dailies/73794/58,2022-02-20T01:49:53.932Z

Very tired today and thankful for this article to chew on https://vickiboykis.com/2022/02/21/on-owning-a-software-problem/

What makes good craftsmanship in data science or analysis is the topic at hand. Vicki argues that in a good analysis a sense of ownership is apparent. 

> A good developer cares about the code they’re putting out into the world not only because it has to work for them, but because their code [will spend most of its time being read and implemented and worked on by others](https://vickiboykis.com/2021/11/07/the-programmers-brain-in-the-lands-of-exploration-and-production/), and as developers, we want to care about those people, too

My spin is that I want the product/analysis to work for the subject matter expert who can recognize nuance. 

This conversation is making me think of the book _Football Dreams_ about a kid who just hopes another former offensive lineman recognizes the work the detail.

Here is an article to chew on @thomasnealley http://mcnamarafallacy.com/

The subtitle is _measurement is not understanding_

Can we find the balance between completely  data driven and going solely on gut? 

Have you seen this  _Office_ episode 

https://youtu.be/DOW_kPzY_JY

> The machine knows 




It is precarious not to ask questions of a measurement. This is the hard part!

Some questions: 

How does the the measurement fit your story of the situation?

How does this measurement contradict your understanding of the situation?

Know your audience! Some will  want free reign of their data most want to be guided on what things mean. This is where data visualization  can shed new perspectives on data. On suggestion for trainers using R is show new users how to use [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). It is fun and you can customize to your hearts content.

_The spreadsheet whisperer_ I don't prefer them and would rather not but if I am forced to I will help others.  

A vendor I work with sent me a locked spreadsheet for testing--(locked can't see or change the formula they are using--ick).    Note open up a locked spreadsheet in Google Sheets and you can eliminate that nonsense. The spreadsheet had a variance of $667 from an expected value



Anyway show your work, indicate what you expected to happen and what actually happened. Find a good use case that can be reproduced. I learned these principals from coding and applied to fixing a spreadsheet.

Yesterday, I wrote about the importance of showing your work. R has a feature called Rmarkdown that lets you intermingle narrative and code.  It lets you show your work and explain to your readers what you are doing--even if the only reader is yourself. 

Here is an example: https://rpubs.com/kgilds/871252 document.

Yesterday, I write about showing your work with Rmarkdown documents. Another concept I want to explore is testing. I learned testing late but I think with the [Pointblank](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/index.html) package one could introduce it earlier. I am not sure where but this package is  useful in pragmatic ways.  The Pointblank package makes is easy to test assumptions about your data and will warn you about issues or in some cases stop the processing of the data.

Duplicate values is a common mistake and I have not figured out how to match them the point of entry. But I want to catch and address them early in the data pipeline. After the data is downloaded from Qualtrics; it runs through an initial cleaning function but before the next step in the pipeline it goes through validation. 

There are functions to keep duplicate values out of the next step of the pipleline but I want to be proactive and say ""hey there is an issue here""


Below is script to  test for duplicates if the id, site and time are all the same, 
```r
df %>%
pointblank::rows_distinct(vars(id, site, time), actions =  pointblank::warn_on_fail()) %>%   
interrogate()

``` 
If it it was a critical flaw; I could change to stop_on_fail. 

I think I could introduce right after how to use basic functions and what a package library is.
