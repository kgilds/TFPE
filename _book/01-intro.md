# Origin Story


A public administration technology course introduced me to databases, and building basic webpages. At the time, I was working at a nonprofit with  data in multiple spreadsheets. I managed to put some critical pieces into a database and even a basic query became powerful and useful. 


I recall starting a new job at a nonprofit organization and noted that the organization had a license for SPSS. However, the challenge was that SPSS and the license were locked down on a worthless laptop. The cost to re-license SPSS was in the thousands and obtaining a new license did not seem worth the investment. This started my quest for alternatives to high priced statistical software.

What I did not know at this time was that nonprofit organizations have access powerful data analysis tools. It is open source software and is not a special program through Tech Soup. 

R and Python are available for any organization to utilize. In Facebook, and Google utilize both R and Python to analyze data.How many nonprofit organizations are even aware of this or have the capacity to take advantage of these tools?

I recall downloading opening R and having no idea what to do with it. Here is a screenshot of what one may find when opening R.
